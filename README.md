OntoCrime is an ontology designed to describe crime events, their characteristics, and contextual information.
It provides classes and properties to represent:

- Types of crimes (e.g., homicide, robbery, assault).
- Victims (demographics, gender, etc.).
- Temporal information (date, time).
- Spatial information (place, neighborhood, city).
- Relationships with existing vocabularies (DBpedia, Schema.org, etc.).
